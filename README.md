# PMCDSS Tasks

This repository contains the work conducted for the module PMCDSS.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- (Optional) Git installed if you plan to clone the repository.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kacperpon/PMCDSS.git
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

- **On macOS/Linux:**

  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- **On Windows:**

  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

You should see the virtual environment name (e.g., `(venv)`) prefixed to your command line prompt.

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required packages using `pip`. Make sure you are in the virtual environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.


### 4. Deactivating the Virtual Environment

When you're done working, you can deactivate the virtual environment by running:

```bash
deactivate
```
